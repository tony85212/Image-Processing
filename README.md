# Scene-Binary-Classification

CS527 Final Project

## Introduction

Using a given scene dataset (including coast and forest) to build a classifier that can distinguish whether the input image is coast or forest.

Challenge:
It only has a small dataset for training. The challenge is that a small data set might lead to overfitting. Also, some testing images are similar to others, forest with a lake, for example. In this experiment, it will also compare the difference size of the dataset.
